## This branch: InfraPad UI integration (local setup)

This branch replaces FleetShift's duplicated InfraPad document pages with the
**built** `@infrapad/ui` package from a sibling checkout. It does not use the
published `quay.io/stolostron/fleetshift:latest` image for this feature. Place
the repositories side by side (`fleetshift/` and `infrapad/` under the same
parent); FleetShift's core plugin has a local `file:` dependency on
`../infrapad/ui/packages/ui`. No package registry or cross-repo CI provisioning
is set up for this prototype.

From the **FleetShift root**, prepare the package before installing/building
FleetShift. The InfraPad checkout needs the shared-request transport and
updated dummy-auth CORS proxy from its corresponding work:

```bash
cd ..
git clone git@github.com:infrapad/infrapad.git
(cd ../infrapad/ui && npm ci && npm run build --workspace @infrapad/ui)
cd fleetshift
npm install                          # from the FleetShift root; links the local package
npx nx run plugins:build             # built ESM/types/CSS via the Rspack plugin build
```

For a local browser journey, start both services (Podman, docker-compose,
[Task](https://taskfile.dev/), and the usual Go/Node prerequisites are needed):

1. In FleetShift's `.env` (copy `.env.template` if needed), set
   `EXTERNAL_UI_CONFIG='{"infrapad":{"origin":"http://localhost:8089"}}'`.
   This is **public** configuration, not a place for secrets. Start the
   source-built sandbox with `npx nx run pd:dev LOCAL_WEB=true`, then in another
   terminal run `npx nx run web:dev` to populate/watch `web/`. If the watch is
   already running, keep it running; don't run `web:build` over it.
2. In `../infrapad`, run the dev-server API.
3. Open [https://fleetshift-sandbox.localhost:8085/app](https://fleetshift-sandbox.localhost:8085/app),
   accept the sandbox certificate warning, sign in as `ops@fleetshift.local` /
   `fleetshift-ops`, and choose **Infrapad** from navigation. Check
   `curl -sk https://fleetshift-sandbox.localhost:8085/api/ui/config` for the
   configured `externalConfig.infrapad.origin` and
   `curl http://localhost:8089/ui/config` if the module cannot load. The `-k`
   flag is only for the local sandbox CA.

After editing InfraPad's shared package, rebuild it and reinstall/refresh the
FleetShift file dependency if npm copied rather than symlinked `dist`; rebuild
FleetShift's plugins when not running a watch. See
[InfraPad's development guide](../infrapad/DEVELOPMENT.md) for standalone and
hot-reload modes, and [the opt-in FleetShift browser journey](e2e/web/README.md#local-infrapad-adapter-journey-opt-in)
for validation. The dummy proxy forwards a bearer but **does not verify its
signature**; direct Go `/v1` access remains anonymous. This local flow tests
browser forwarding/CORS, not production authorization, TLS/CORS, or
Prometheus authentication.

This repository represents both a **prototype** for a next generation k8s/OpenShift cluster management vision, alongside **individual POCs** for exploration of isolated concepts.

## Start here

The fastest way to try FleetShift is the all-in-one image (API, UI, and peer
Dex in one container). Needs **podman**. Sandbox only — not a production
deployment.

Open https://fleetshift-sandbox.localhost:8085 (redirects to `/app`) and accept
the browser certificate warning (unknown sandbox CA — Advanced/Proceed or
Accept Risk). Publish ports on `127.0.0.1` only.

Demo users (login is the email): `ops@fleetshift.local` / `fleetshift-ops` and
`dev@fleetshift.local` / `fleetshift-dev`.

### Bare run (peer Dex)

No OIDC flags. Packaging starts Dex and fills AuthMethod/UI defaults.

```bash
podman run \
  -p 127.0.0.1:8085:8085 \
  -p 127.0.0.1:50051:50051 \
  quay.io/stolostron/fleetshift:latest
```

### With kind

Privileged + host engine socket (local/dev only). Create the network once:
`podman network create kind`. The `fleetshift` network alias is required.
Linux rootless: `systemctl --user enable --now podman.socket` and
`export PODMAN_SOCKET=$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/podman/podman.sock` (not
`/var/run/docker.sock`).

```bash
podman run \
  --privileged \
  -p 127.0.0.1:8085:8085 \
  -p 127.0.0.1:50051:50051 \
  -v /tmp:/tmp \
  -v ${PODMAN_SOCKET:-/var/run/docker.sock}:/var/run/docker.sock \
  --network kind:alias=fleetshift \
  quay.io/stolostron/fleetshift:latest
```

### With GCP HCP

Peer Dex cannot back this addon. Set an external issuer and the CLS gateway;
packaging turns `gcphcp` on. Register
`https://fleetshift-sandbox.localhost:8085`, `/app/auth/callback`, and
`/app/silent-renew.html` on that IdP.

```bash
podman run \
  -p 127.0.0.1:8085:8085 \
  -p 127.0.0.1:50051:50051 \
  -e OIDC_ISSUER_URL=https://your-oidc-issuer/realms/fleetshift \
  -e GCPHCP_GATEWAY_URL=https://your-cls-gateway \
  quay.io/stolostron/fleetshift:latest
```

Add the kind flags from above when you also want local clusters (keep
`OIDC_ISSUER_URL`).

Build the image from this repo with `npx nx run image:aio`. Env defaults, Dex-off,
fleetctl, and packaging internals:
[deploy/aio/README.md](deploy/aio/README.md).

## Develop in this repo

### Prerequisites

- **Go 1.22+**
- **Node.js 20+** — for Nx and UI packages
- **buf** — for protobuf generation (`brew install bufbuild/buf/buf`)
- `.env` file — copy from `.env.template` (compose stack and Kubernetes only)

Deployment-specific tools (podman, oc, kind, etc.) are listed in each
deployment guide.

### Setup

```bash
npm install                 # install all workspace dependencies (from repo root)
```

All UI packages are npm workspaces declared at the root. A single `npm install`
at the repo root handles everything — no separate install needed per package.

### Monorepo

This workspace uses [Nx](https://nx.dev) for build orchestration — caching,
dependency graph, affected detection, and parallel execution.

```bash
npx nx show projects        # list all projects
npx nx graph                # visualize dependency graph
npx nx run server:test      # run a single target (cached)
npx nx run-many -t test     # run target across all projects (parallel)
npx nx affected -t test     # only test what changed
```

Projects: `server`, `cli`, `deploy-aio`, `proto`, `web`, `common`, `build-utils`, `plugins`.

### Build

```bash
npx nx run server:build     # server
npx nx run cli:build        # fleetctl CLI
npx nx run deploy-aio:build # AIO packaging binaries
npx nx run common:build     # shared UI types/helpers
npx nx run plugins:build    # all MF remote plugins
npx nx run web:build        # SPA shell
npx nx run-many -t build    # build all (parallel, cached)

```

Builds are cached — unchanged sources skip recompilation entirely.

### UI development

`web:dev` is **not** a standalone TLS origin — it rebuilds the SPA shell and
MF plugins on change into the repo-root `web/` dir, which the running AIO
stack serves. Run it in a second terminal alongside the stack:

```bash
npx nx run pd:dev LOCAL_WEB=true   # terminal 1: stack serves UI from host web/
npx nx run web:dev                 # terminal 2: full build, then watch-rebuild
npx nx run web:dev:watch           # terminal 2 alt: watch only (skip initial build)
```

Then open **https://fleetshift-sandbox.localhost:8085** (redirects to `/app`)
and accept the browser certificate warning. Dex is same-origin under `/idp`.

```bash
npx nx run web:test:ct      # component tests (playwright)
npx nx run plugins:test:ct  # plugin component tests
```

UI packages: `web` (SPA shell), `common` (shared types), `build-utils` (rspack
helpers), `plugins` (12 MF remotes)

### Test

```bash
npx nx run-many -t test     # unit tests for all modules
npx nx affected -t test     # only test what changed
npx nx run server:test      # Go server tests (cached)
npx nx run deploy-aio:test  # AIO packaging unit tests
npx nx run common:test      # shared UI lib tests

npx nx test:e2e e2e-web      # Playwright UI journeys (needs AIO at :8085)
npx nx test:e2e e2e-cli      # Playwright CLI journeys (fleetctl, Kind, delivery)
```

Frontend e2e expects the sandbox origin
(`https://fleetshift-sandbox.localhost:8085`). Playwright flags after `--`,
for example `npx nx test:e2e e2e-web -- --ui` — see
[e2e/web/README.md](e2e/web/README.md). CLI e2e builds fleetctl and starts
the same shared sandbox runner. How to add tests, Kind pool usage, and CI:
[docs/testing/end-to-end.md](docs/testing/end-to-end.md).

### Generate and images

```bash
npx nx run proto:generate   # regenerate protobuf and gRPC stubs

```

## Local compose stack

The local harness (`pd:*` Nx targets) runs the all-in-one image via
compose and is documented in [deploy/podman/README.md](deploy/podman/README.md).
Copy `.env.template` to `.env` first. Commands are also available through Nx;
env vars (`LOCAL_WEB`, `DEV`, `BUILD`, `NX_CACHE`) pass through to deployment scripts.

Open https://fleetshift-sandbox.localhost:8085 after `pd:up` / `pd:dev`. If a
persisted volume still has the old `https://127.0.0.1:5556/dex` issuer, run
`npx nx run pd:clean` once.

```bash
npx nx run pd:dev                                    # build AIO from source, start stack
npx nx run pd:dev LOCAL_WEB=true                     # + serve UI from host web/ (watch mode)
npx nx run pd:up                                     # start stack (prebuilt image)
npx nx run pd:down                                   # stop stack
npx nx run pd:clean                                  # stop + remove volumes
npx nx run pd:status                                 # show container status
npx nx run pd:logs                                   # tail all logs
npx nx run pd:rebuild                                # rebuild and restart
npx nx run pd:clock-drift                            # fix podman clock drift

```

Point at an external issuer by setting `OIDC_ISSUER_URL` in `.env` (peer Dex
then parks) — see the OIDC scope caveat in `.env.template`.

Keycloak OCP (`kc:*`), Kubernetes OCP (`k8s:*`), and MinIO (`minio:*`) targets
use Nx and target remote clusters, not local compose.
