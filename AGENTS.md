# Rules for Agents

This is the monorepo for FleetShift, a fleet management platform. It contains the management-plane server, CLI, proto definitions, React web UI, and proof-of-concept experiments. Please follow these rules very closely. It is very important.

# General Guidelines for working with Nx

- For navigating/exploring the workspace, invoke the `nx-workspace` skill first - it has patterns for querying projects, targets, and dependencies
- When running tasks (for example build, lint, test, e2e, etc.), always prefer running the task through `nx` (i.e. `nx run`, `nx run-many`, `nx affected`) instead of using the underlying tooling directly
- Prefix nx commands with the workspace's package manager (e.g., `pnpm nx build`, `npm exec nx test`) - avoids using globally installed CLI
- You have access to the Nx MCP server and its tools, use them to help the user
- For Nx plugin best practices, check `node_modules/@nx/<plugin>/PLUGIN.md`. Not all plugins have this file - proceed without it if unavailable.
- NEVER guess CLI flags - always check nx_docs or `--help` first when unsure

## Scaffolding & Generators

- For scaffolding tasks (creating apps, libs, project structure, setup), ALWAYS invoke the `nx-generate` skill FIRST before exploring or calling MCP tools

## When to use nx_docs

- USE for: advanced config options, unfamiliar flags, migration guides, plugin configuration, edge cases
- DON'T USE for: basic generator syntax (`nx g @nx/react:app`), standard commands, things you already know
- The `nx-generate` skill handles generator discovery internally - don't call nx_docs just to look up generator syntax

## Understanding the domain

The architecture documentation lives in docs/design/ and is the primary source of truth for domain concepts, system design, and open questions.

- Start with docs/design/architecture.md -- it gives the system's core mental model, names the major subsystems, and contains a reading guide that routes to the detailed sub-documents in docs/design/architecture/:
 - core_model.md -- core vocabulary, strategy axes, fulfillment kernel primitive, target model, delivery contract, single-pod invariant
 - target_delivery_contract.md -- detailed target delivery protocol, reliability guarantees, generation ordering, journaling, observation reporting
 - orchestration.md -- fulfillment execution, re-evaluation, rollout
  - fleetlet_and_transport.md -- fleetlets, channels, proxying, routing, data paths
  - tenancy_and_permissions.md -- provider/tenant/workspace model, generic permission boundary
  - addon_integration.md -- capability registration, addon strategy contracts, managed-resource bridging, UI/API extensions
  - resource_identity_and_api.md -- two-layer API model, resource identity, platform resources, extension API packages, HTTP transcoding
  - resource_indexing.md -- fleet-wide indexing and search
  - platform_hierarchy.md -- recursive platforms, federation, provisioning, bootstrap, pivot
  - open_questions.md -- unresolved design areas
- For authentication and delivery authorization, see docs/design/authentication.md and poc/attestation/hybrid/README.md
- For managed resources, see docs/design/managed_resources.md

## Designing and defining APIs

- For gRPC / proto generation and linting, see docs/buf.md
- For API design conventions (AIP-aligned), see docs/api-design.md

## Cross-cutting concerns (very important)

- This is a prototype. Don't be afraid to break contracts if it would produce a more ideal design for the task at hand. We'd rather learn and experiment with a potentially better way. There's little value to backwards compatibility for compatibility's sake.
- _Please don't casually remove comments unless they are truly no longer relevant_ (e.g. a TODO that is now implemented or obsolete, or out of date explanations). Prefer updates to removal, unless behavior is obvious from the code or signature.
- Keep design documentation up to date, but focused on the design and vision. _Do not overfit design documentation to the code, specific API, or current implementation_. It is a guide for how we intend the implementation to evolve, more than it is a description of its current state. We should update them when, during the course of implementation and planning, we realize that the design and vision itself should change, or has become out of alignment with what we are building in non-temporary ways. References to code or API are far from forbidden, but just used judiciously, to tie the desired design to the prototype.
- Prefer modern stdlib abstractions and utilities where relevant (especially around crypto or low level encoding / decoding)
- Follow test-driven development. When at all possible, write failing tests **first**, then write the code to make the test pass.
- Prefer running tasks through Nx (`npx nx run <project>:<target>`, `npx nx run-many`, `npx nx affected`) for caching and dependency-aware execution. Build, test, proto, image, and infrastructure targets run through Nx; deployment scripts provide platform-specific checks.
- Please always run go fmt ./... after you're done with any Go code changes

## fleetshift-server

Read the relevant docs below **before** writing or modifying code in this module. They contain design rules that are easy to violate without context.

For how to...

- decide what logic to put where (layering, service boundaries, method signatures), see server/docs/internal-architecture.md
- implement instrumentation (observability: tracing, logging, metrics), see server/docs/observer-pattern.md
- decide what package to use, see server/docs/package-structure.md
- write tests, see server/docs/testing.md
- write durable workflows and integrate with durable computing libraries, see server/docs/durable-workflows.md
- write or modify constructors, see server/docs/constructors.md
- write domain objects (aggregates, entities, values, where invariants belong, snapshot persistence), see server/docs/domain.md

When running tests, iterate with `go test ./...` (the default suite excludes Docker-heavy integration tests). Tests gated behind `//go:build integration` require `-tags integration` and a container runtime; run them explicitly when working on that code (e.g. `go test -tags integration ./internal/addon/kind/`) and/or to verify we haven't broken anything before completing.

## FleetShift UI

This is the complete frontend web app for fleetshift. See docs/ui/AGENTS.md for agent instructions.

### IMPORTANT NOTE ON HOT-RELOAD

The developer is usually running `npx nx run web:dev:watch` in the background, that
live-reloads the changes. Don't run `web:build` explicitly, as it breaks the live-reload feature.
